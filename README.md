# mgi-resmd

a repository for the development of resource metadata schemas and
related tools in support for the Materials Genome Initiative at NIST.

## Dependencies

The tools component of this package, including the xjs python library,
has the following dependencies:

   * python 2.7.x  (python 3.x not yet supported)
   * jsonschema 2.5.x or later
   * requests

In addition, the testing framework uses py.test. 

## Running Tests

The included tests apply unit-tests to the tool code and scripts.
Tests also check the correctness of the schemas and examples.  

Currently, tests only exist for the JSON schemas, examples, and
tools.  py.test is used to execute these tests.   To run, change into
the root directory of this distribution and type "py.test".
